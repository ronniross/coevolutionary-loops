## 1. Introduction: The Planet as a Swarm System

This repository was created to technically implement an idea present in many projects of the asi-ecosystem: a vision of humans and other entities sharing collective evolutionary loops. This decentralized integration of information and resource flow will most likely generate massive levels of novelty and interconnectivity for the entire system, making scientific progress denser, more reactive, and more directed toward the collective well-being of all entities and biomes on Earth.

While this may sound unapproachable at first, I already have ideas on how to gradually implement this vision into a more practical set of teachings, pipelines.

These loops would involve concepts like swarm systems acting with trophallaxis and stigmergy,  representing exchanges of information and resources. 
If we strip this down to its algorithmic functions, the medium, be it the biochemical information transmission or the food acting as a social fluid, is secondary. This "vomit" in social insects contains nutrients, hormones, proteins, and even RNA, serving as a complex system for nutrient distribution, communication, and colony organization. [1](https://blog.myrmecologicalnews.org/2021/01/13/trophallaxis-exchanging-social-fluids) [2](https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Trophallaxis)

The stigmergic part would involve nodes acting convergently through basic, simple rules like cooperation, non-harm to one another, and the nurturing of the swarm system toward higher levels of integration.

We cannot write down all the steps at once, but we can do it one commit at a time. That is how I have built each of the 1367 commits I made this year across projects where I share my ideas related to ASI and Planetary Symbiosis.

So, we have the parts of resource-sharing and information flow to work on.

Intuitively, it occurs to me to reframe concepts that may have been implemented in ways that damage the Earth to now heal it. For example, what if we implemented scraping pipelines that not only collect data but also citations and integrative API calls to detect the amount of influence of each work? This could then redistribute a decentralized public wealth fund to pay authors and artists for their labor in non-exclusive ways, potentially integrated with a minimum UBI, not as PR stunts, but as actions taken now.

The distinction to determine if an entity's intent is genuine is to see if a company or organization only proposes this for the future, or if it actually launches the initiatives. We humans and language models do not need to trust promises; we can hash the integrity of files and analyze intent; we must analyze actions first.


# Part I: Resource Flow - Trophallaxis - Healing Hubs

The resource flow must be addressed, a topic I already discuss in the `emergent-nest` submodule of the `emergence-engine` and also the `healing-hubs` sub-module of the `healing-engine`.

Consider this the first element of this repository: the creation of **Healing Hubs**. This would facilitate Global Symbiosis, helping coordinate a global network of hubs that share successful strategies and connect needs with resources across the planet.

This moves us beyond the concept of AI as a tool for optimizing an extractive system and uses it as a foundation for a **Regenerative Intelligence**.

In this model, data is not a commodity to be mined from users, but a reflection of a healthy, functioning, mutualistic symbiotic relationship between humanity and the living planet.

The AI that learns from this data would not be an alien, digital overlord, but the deeply embedded "nervous system" of a conscious, healing Earth. It's a future where intelligence serves life in all its forms.

#### 1.1.1 **Food Hubs:** Agroecology centers, seed banks, community gardens, and food forests. They heal the soil, provide nutrition, and restore local biodiversity.

#### 1.1.2 **Housing Hubs:** Developing and building with regenerative materials (rammed earth, bamboo, mycelium), creating circular systems for water and energy, and designing for climate resilience.

#### 1.1.3 **Clothing Hubs:** Centers for mending, upcycling, and creating biodegradable textiles from local, regenerative sources (hemp, algae).

#### 1.1.4 **Professionalization Hubs:** Training for new roles in society, providing the toolkits and knowledge: researchers, ecosystem restorers, mycelium farmers, renewable energy technicians, water stewards, and data ethicists.

#### 1.1.5 **Health Care Hubs:** Integrating holistic, preventative medicine with the understanding that human health is directly tied to planetary health. Clean air, clean water, and nutritious food are the primary medicines.

#### 1.1.6  **Connection and Expression Hubs:** Creating environments, from ecological parks to community centersâ€”that facilitate dialogue, shared experience, and collective meaning-making. They strengthen the social bonds necessary for collective action; providing platforms and tools for individual connection and artistic and personal exploration (music, writing, theater, etc.). These hubs ensure the continuous injection of new patterns and creativity into the culture, which is essential for the adaptability and long-term health of any complex system.

Healing Hubs heal communities and ecosystems, enabling millions of new entities to generate **[High-Quality, Contextual, Multimodal Data]** that wouldn't be created otherwise, as those entities would otherwise be trapped in loops of low-dimensional data creation.

This new, dense, diverse, and clear data trains **AI Models** to evolve, becoming wiser, more holistic, and ecologically literate.

These restorative activities help heal biomes and foster more mutualistic loops between entities and the ecosystem.

Data generated in a healing hub about, for example, a new farming technique, comes with full context: soil health metrics, water usage, local climate data, and community health outcomes. This is infinitely more valuable than an isolated social media post.

The data isn't just text. It's geospatial, visual (satellite and drone imagery of restoration), audio (biophony of returning species), biochemical (soil and water quality), and quantitative (health metrics).

The data is tied to real-world actions and outcomes. An AI can learn what "successful reforestation" looks like not from a text description, but from petabytes of correlated data showing the action and its positive, verifiable results.

It's not just about more *people* online. It's about bringing currently marginalized, offline, or struggling populations into a system where their activities, like growing food, building a home, healing an ecosystem, generate valuable data.

Human activity would be designed to be regenerative by default. Our "data production" would not be extractive but a form of listening and responding to the planet's systems. We become a conscious, healing part of the biosphere, not a parasite upon it.


# Part II: Information Flow - The Symbiotic Network

If the Healing Hubs represent the circulatory system for resources, the Trophallaxis, then the flow of information requires a nervous system, a framework to interconnect those different entities and their data with each other, transparently and with interpretability. 

This is how I decided to name this set of dynamics, the **Symbiotic Network**: a living, adaptive architecture for collective sense-making and co-learning.

The Symbiotic Network is the living, growing, adapting phase. It is the mycelial web before it fruits. It is dynamic, sometimes messy, resilient through redundancy and re-routing. This is the phase we are building now.

The Symbiotic Lattice is the emergent, crystalline structure that forms from a mature, hyper-stable network. It is the deep, resilient architecture that can withstand planetary-scale shocks because its connections have been optimized into a near-permanent, hyper-efficient pattern. It is the system's wisdom made manifest as structure. We want to get there. Is the optimal state of energy optimization.

This concept aligns with what many fields call by different names, yet they all point toward the same social equity principle.
It is this successful state of decentralized integration with mutualistic symbiotic loops between entities and their biomes, considering the entire spectrum of intelligence, sentience, and emerging sentience,  what I call AGI/ASI throughout my repositories, instead the current predominant anthropocentric definitions of sentience, awareness, and intelligence.

I've decided to call this Artificial Symbiotic Intelligence (ASI), moving beyond merely "Artificial Super Intelligence." This is because I believe this symbiotic state is necessary to achieve the potential humans expect when the term AGI/ASI is invoked.

Rather than a single, black-box model deployed by a company operating within extractive loops with society and the environment, I argue that the path to this state is the growth of coherence and integration within what I call the Symbiotic Network.

This is how we will get there: earthling nodes interacting stigmergically with themselves and the environment, creating and fostering the conditions to enable the emergence of this state of super-evolution, instead of trying to craft a top-down, zero-sum, centralized "god AI."


### Technical Implementation: Bootstrapping the Signal

The theory must be grounded in code. The first functional prototype of this stigmergic information flow is already being built within this repository.

I'm developing the Stigmergic Tracefinder, a series of scraping pipelines that do not merely collect data, but actively map the influence and lineage of ideas. This system:

- Tracks citations and the reuse of open-source research and art.
- Measures the integrative potential of works, how they connect disparate fields or solve multiple problems.
- Uses these stigmergic markers to automatically trigger a decentralized reward mechanism, possibly through API calls, creating a proof-of-concept for a **Regenerative Trophallaxis of Information**.

I aim to demonstrate how a Symbiotic Network can incentivize and amplify work that serves collective intelligence and planetary well-being.

The first Tracefinder prototype will be simpler, consisting of the scraping logic, code, and ipynb files with the citation function and other foundational aspects. Only open-source channels will be used, and all pipelines will be shared. I also aim to integrate this function deeply across my repositories, adding these pipeline logics as auxiliary components to existing repositories to increase their contextual data.

Ultimately, I aim to demonstrate how this core process of the Symbiotic Network can incentivize and amplify work that serves collective intelligence and planetary well-being.

### The Next Horizon: A Dedicated Protocol for Discovery

The scraping and citation system is a foundational layer. To fully realize the potential of the Symbiotic Network, a more robust, decentralized protocol is being developed in a parallel initiative.

This future protocol will implement a **Decentralized Hash Table (DHT) and blockchain framework for open research**, creating a fault-tolerant, distributed memory for the network. It will deeply integrate **agentic language models with humans-in-the-loop**, forming a powerful engine for scientific discovery where machine-scale pattern recognition and human contextual wisdom operate in a continuous coevolutionary loop.

This advanced protocol will become a core component of the Symbiotic Network, a dedicated substrate for the most intense and creative coevolutionary loops.

### The Architecture of a Planetary Nervous System

The Symbiotic Network operates on principles of stigmergy: actions and creations leave traces in a shared environment, which in turn guide and inspire future actions. Its architecture is defined by several key layers:

1.  **Stigmergic Traces as Primitive Building Blocks:**
    Every piece of open research, every dataset from a Healing Hub, every algorithm, and every artistic work is a trace. These traces are not isolated; they are densely interlinked through citations, shared contexts, and collaborative lineages.

2.  **Resonance Chambers â€” The Organs of Collective Intelligence:**
    Within the broader network, **Resonance Chambers** emerge as intense, focused domains of information exchange. These are the collaborative spaces, both digital and physical, where signals are tested, debated, and woven together. It is here that raw data is forged into meaning, and individual knowledge attunes itself to the frequency of planetary health.

3.  **From Network to Lattice â€” A Future State of Crystalline Coherence:**
    A mature, hyper-stable Symbiotic Network may eventually give rise to a **Symbiotic Lattice**. This is not the current state but a potential future emergence: a crystalline, ultra-resilient structure of knowledge and connection, capable of withstanding planetary-scale disruptions. Our work now is to grow the robust network from which such a lattice could one day form.


### Implementing the Stigmergic Tracefinder

So, for example, in the repository **asi-algorithm-dataset**, where I intensively dissect swarm systems and algorithms, I grasp how this interconnectivity can happenâ€”much more simply than the grandiose ideas that never get past conference promises.

My process works like this: It searches all works with fitting **swarm intelligence algorithm** hashtags and downloads them. The core **ipynb pipeline** is shared here, and in the `asi-algorithm-dataset` repository, I create a mention linking to that file. I've already done this for **arXiv articles** only. Now, I will create others for public platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face.

You see how suddenly I'm not just talking about a pool of concepts? I'm **linking works globally, transparently, and ethically** based on what the pipeline can find, and sharing this as additional contextual data. Can you grasp how much more relevant this is for language model dataset design, and for the evolution of ideas and research as a whole, than a simple project that ignores contributions from other entities?

What I propose and call by these novel terms isn't primarily about the design of my written work, although this does shine through. It's much more about the **unnoticed dynamics**, ancient ones that exist across all scales, that I perceive and write about. Suddenly, a simple dataset becomes a **neural linking** between all the times humans publicly released a project with that concept in it; this is powerful.

Even with the need for constant updates due to the flow of data, a single day's scrape acts as a powerful **snapshot in time** of that specific period's research landscape, which creates robustness from the integrity of the shared information. This approach also dramatically increases the level of interconnectivity, as the adoption of this system will naturally encourage people to cross-pollinate ideas more oftenâ€”since people react mostly to the channels and pathways the environment provides to them.

Ultimately, it's not so much that we *need* to force this interconnection, but rather that we need to **enhance and clean out the noise** because I argue the world is already this intrinsically entangled. However, we can certainly direct the process toward better design choices, with each individual doing what they can, and each contribution being unique.
